wtv-client-serial-number: 81xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
wtv-system-version: 16276
wtv-client-bootrom-version: 2046
wtv-client-rom-type: US-LC2-disk-0MB-8MB
wtv-system-chipversion: 53608448
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 WebTV/2.8.2 (compatible; MSIE 4.0)
wtv-system-cpuspeed: 166164662
wtv-system-sysconfig: 3116068
wtv-disk-size: 8006
wtv-capability-flags: 1fee0e1d9b1ffdef

Plus a few other modifications.

Since WebTV is now gone I used this viewer to help/test in my quest of building a custom WebTV build for the actual WebTV Plus box with a hard drive and the WebTV Echostar. I have left the files here so even if you do not own a real WebTV box you can still use the custom build minus Doom, and MAME. More info here http://turdinc.kicks-ass.net/Msntv/WebTV-MAME/index.html

To access a demo of the custom build using the viewer simply access file://Disk/Browser/Games/Games.html

Update 2019
No need to access file://Disk/Browser/Games/Games.html just connect to the server EMU and select the MattMan link on the Home Page. This works separate from the EMU as if it was actually on the WebTV disk.
