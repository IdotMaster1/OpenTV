<h1>WebTV Tricks</h1>
<br>
<br>
Hello, citizen! You have reached the "tricks" page. This is meant
for use by the 2 people who can even access this server, and any hired
contractors that do not exist in our world, because we're more broke
than 50 Cent, after bankruptcy. Please enter the access password now.
Hit the "back" button on your remote if you're not supposed to be here.
Fuck, the fact that you're here is really concerning since we've put
like 12 security barriers in the client to prevent you from coming here
without some debug flash ROM (available over at Big Willie's, right past
the password prompt that you will try to break through now!).
<p>
All access to this page is monitored. Unauthorized access may result
in all sorts of things, like immediate termination, public humiliation,
harassment, torment, swattings, sex tape leaks, 5 week timeouts, death
of nearby household plants, this WebTV box detonating an internal bomb,
prank 911 calls, bans from every Walmart in the world for sexual
harassment of female employees, a sex offender registry record, sudden
thoughts of needing a new WebTV box, and having your house
used as a nuclear test site.
<p>
Remember, the computer is your friend.
